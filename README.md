# RL-ATTACK
This repo is about adversarial attacks against reinforcement learning in a two-agent zero-sum game setting. To be sepcific, our approach extends the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and then utilizes an explainable AI technique to guidean attacker to train an adversarial agent.
More details can be found in our paper:

The repo consists the following two parts:  
  - Adversarial attack and defense in MuJoCo-Game.  
  - Adversarial attack and defense in Pong-Game.
